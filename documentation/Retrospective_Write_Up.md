# Team Division of Labor:
  - Search bar – Alfonso
  - Creating new posts – Karen
  - Dropdown filter – Antonette
  - Backend – Grant
  - Displaying posts - Rikki
  
# Challenges:
- Learning React in under a week so we could create a working demo. Only Grant has worked with React before.
- Docker (what we are using to connect the frontend and the backend) does not work on Windows without paying for a special version, so some people are not able to test their own code.

# Features not in the Demo:
- Everything that is currently in the product backlog and not in the "done" category on Trello.

# Retrospective
- If we had more time we would have made the website more visually appealing. As for right now, it is extremely bare bones. However, we did a great job of finishing our goals for the demo in the short amount of time that we had.
